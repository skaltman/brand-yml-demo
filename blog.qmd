## Why **brand.yml**?

### Consistent branding is difficult 

Consistent branding ensures your work looks professional, cohesive, and polished, but applying brand guidelines can be challenging. Your brand guidelines might include detailed requirements for logos, colors, and fonts. Handling branding separately for each product or output takes time and effort, and small inconsistencies can add up.

Other common challenges with traditional approaches to branding include:

* **Excessive manual effort**: Applying colors, fonts, and logos across reports, apps, and dashboards takes time and is prone to errors.

* **Difficult to update**: When brand guidelines change, it’s difficult to update all products consistently.

* **Team consistency**: Ensuring all contributors follow branding guidelines across reports, dashboards, and apps can be challenging to manage. 

### The solution: **brand.yml**

Enter [**brand.yml**](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/). We created **brand.yml** to simplify the process of applying branding guidelines to your work. With **brand.yml**, you can define your organization's branding in a single YAML file and apply that branding across reports, dashboards, and apps created with Posit’s open-source tools.

### Advantages of **brand.yml**

**brand.yml** allows you to collect a brand's logos, colors, fonts, and typographic choices into a single `_brand.yml` file, which you can then apply instantly across Quarto reports, Shiny apps, and more.

Here are some advantages of this strategy:

* **Consistency without effort** Ensure all your work consistently follows brand guidelines and avoid duplication by defining branding in one file that can be applied across projects.

* **Easy collaboration** Share a single `_brand.yml` file across your organization to ensure everyone can easily apply the same branding, eliminating the need for contributors to recreate brand-specific designs for every project.

* **Not just for corporate branding** You can also use **brand.yml** to create custom themes for your personal or team-specific projects. Create a `_brand.yml` file for a specific journal or conference to ensure your work matches their style. 

## See **brand.yml** in action

Let's see how **brand.yml** works. The first step is to define your brand elements, including logos, colors, fonts, and typography, in a single `_brand.yml` file. 

Below is an example `_brand.yml` file that defines metadata, logos, a color palette, and font and typographic choices for an example brand. Learn more about the structure of a `_brand.yml` file [here](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/brand/).


```yaml
meta: 
  name: Example Company
  link: 
    github: https://github.com/skaltman/brand-yml-blog

logo: 
  medium: logos/logo.png

color:
  palette:
    black: "#1C2826"
    blue: "#0C0A3E" 
    gray: "#2A2E45"
    neutral: "#F9F7F1" 
    red: "#BA274A"
    violet: "#4D6CFA"
  background: neutral
  foreground: black
  primary: blue
  secondary: violet
  info: red

typography:
  fonts:
    - family: Nunito Sans
      source: google
    - family: Montserrat
      source: google
    - family: Fira Code
      source: google

  base: Nunito Sans
  headings:
    family: Montserrat
    weight: 700
    color: primary
  monospace: Fira Code

  link:
    color: info
    decoration: underline
```

Now, we can place our `_brand.yml` file in the directory of a Shiny app or Quarto document to apply the specified branding. Currently, `_brand.yml` can be used by [Quarto 1.6](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/brand.html) and [Shiny for Python](https://shiny.posit.co/blog/posts/shiny-python-1.2-brand-yml/).

### Quarto

To apply branding to your Quarto document, place `_brand.yml` in the root directory of your Quarto project or in the same directory as your documents. Quarto will automatically use your `_brand.yml` file to theme the output.

::: {.callout-note}
Currently, the `html`, `dashboard`, `revealjs` and `typst` formats support **brand.yml**.
:::

We applied our example `_brand.yml` file to a Quarto website. You can see the Quarto file [here](https://github.com/skaltman/brand-yml-blog/blob/main/index.qmd). Here's what the site looks like with no branding:

![](images/quarto-no-branding.png)

and with our `_brand.yml` file in the root directory of the Quarto project:

![](images/quarto-branding.png)

Quarto automatically themed the website according to the `_brand.yml` file, creating a polished and branded site.

::: {.callout-note}
**brand.yml** is not currently supported for Matplotlib. To brand the plots, we created a [function that generates a Matplotlib style sheet](https://github.com/skaltman/brand-yml-blog/blob/main/mplstyle.py) (`.mplstyle` file) from a `_brand.yml` file.
:::

See [Multiformat branding with `_brand.yml`](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/brand.html) to learn more about using **brand.yml** with Quarto.

### Shiny

We applied the same `_brand.yml` file to a Shiny for Python app, transforming this basic app:

![](images/shiny-no-branding.png)

into this branded app:

![](images/shiny-branding.png)

To use **brand.yml** with Shiny for Python:

1. Install the latest version of Shiny for Python with the `theme` extra:

```bash
pip install shiny[theme]
```

2. Create a `_brand.yml` file in your project directory.

3. Use `ui.Theme.from_brand()` to create a custom Shiny theme from your `_brand.yml`.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Express

```python
from shiny.express import input, render, ui

ui.page_opts(theme=ui.Theme.from_brand(__file__))
```

## Core

```python
from shiny import ui

app_ui = ui.page_fluid(
    # app ui code
    theme=ui.Theme.from_brand(__file__)
)
```

### brand_yml Python package

You can use the [**brand_yml** Python package](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/pkg/py/) to read and apply the `_brand.yml` file. We used the Python package to write the [function that creates the Matplotlib style sheet](https://github.com/skaltman/brand-yml-blog/blob/main/mplstyle.py). 

## Create a `_brand.yml` with an LLM

Ready to convert your brand guidelines into a `_brand.yml` file? You can use an LLM to substantially speed up the process. To learn more, take a look at [Creating a brand.yml with an LLM](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/articles/llm-brand-yml-prompt/).

## Coming soon to **brand.yml**

Currently, Shiny for Python and Quarto support **brand.yml**. **brand.yml** is under active development. You can see a diagram of what we plan to support [here](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/#support).

For now, look forward to:

* Support for Shiny for R
* Plot and table branding, including [plotnine](https://plotnine.org/), [gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/), and [great_tables](https://posit-dev.github.io/great-tables/)
* Additional developments in LLM tools that make it easy to generate a `_brand.yml` file

## Conclusion

**brand.yml** enables unified branding for your dashboards, reports, and apps with a single file. Define your brand once and apply it seamlessly across projects-—avoiding numerous manual updates and inconsistencies. Learn more and get started at https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/.
